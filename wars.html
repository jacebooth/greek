      <div>
        <h2>⚡ Titanomachy</h2>
        <p>
          The Titanomachy was a ten-year cosmic battle between the mighty Titans and the emerging Olympians, led by Zeus. 
          Cronus, the King of the Titans, feared a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him, 
          and he had devoured them at birth. Zeus, hidden by his mother Rhea, grew in secret and later freed his siblings, 
          Hades and Poseidon. With the aid of the hundred-handed Hecatoncheires and the powerful Cyclopes, 
          the young Olympians challenged the rule of the Titans. After a decade of fierce battles across earth, sky, and sea, 
          Zeus and his allies triumphed. The defeated Titans were cast into Tartarus, bound forever by divine chains, 
          and the Olympians established themselves as the new rulers of the cosmos.

      <div>
        <h2>🗿 Gigantomachy</h2>
        <p>
          The Gigantomachy was the legendary war between the Olympian gods and the Giants, born from Gaia’s fury against the Olympians. 
          Angered by the Titans’ defeat and the rise of Zeus, she birthed monstrous Giants to challenge the divine order. 
          The gods fought valiantly, but it was Heracles, the mortal demigod, whose strength and courage turned the tide. 
          Lightning, thunder, and divine powers clashed across the cosmos, shaking mountains and rivers. 
          Ultimately, the Olympians prevailed, defeating the Giants and securing their supremacy. 
          This war symbolized the victory of order over chaos and established the gods’ authority over both heaven and earth.

    <!-- TROJAN WAR -->
    <div class="section" id="trojan">
      <div>
        <h2>🔥 Trojan War</h2>
        <p>
          The Trojan War, one of the most famous conflicts in Greek mythology, was sparked by the abduction of Helen of Troy by Paris. 
          This ten-year war drew heroes from all corners of Greece, including Achilles, Hector, and Odysseus. 
          Gods and goddesses chose sides—Athena, Hera, and Poseidon supported the Greeks, while Aphrodite aided the Trojans. 
          Battles raged across the plains of Troy, and countless lives were lost. 
          The war culminated in the cunning use of the Trojan Horse, a strategy devised by Odysseus, 
          allowing the Greeks to enter the city walls undetected and ultimately destroy Troy. 
          The war had profound consequences, shaping the destinies of gods and mortals alike.

    <div class="section" id="seven">
      <div>
        <h2>🛡️ Seven Against Thebes</h2>
        <p>
          The war of the Seven Against Thebes was fought when seven champions marched to attack the city of Thebes, 
          seeking to restore Polynices to the throne. Led by Adrastus, each hero targeted a different gate of the city, 
          bringing immense destruction. The battle ended in tragedy: Polynices and his brother Eteocles killed each other 
          in combat, fulfilling a cursed prophecy that had plagued their family. This war highlighted the fragile nature 
          of human ambition, divine intervention, and the inevitable consequences of pride and fate.

      <div>
        <h2>⚔️ Wars of the Gods</h2>
        <p>
          Even the gods themselves were not immune to conflict. The Olympians often fought amongst each other, 
          driven by jealousy, revenge, or disputes over mortal affairs. Hera repeatedly challenged Zeus’ authority, 
          Athena clashed with Ares over strategies in battle, and Aphrodite’s interventions often caused turmoil. 
          These divine wars had far-reaching consequences, influencing mortal battles and the fates of kingdoms. 
          From Mount Olympus to the mortal world, the gods’ rivalries shaped history, reminding humanity 
          that the divine could be as unpredictable as it was powerful.
