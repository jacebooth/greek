      Welcome to Greek Mythology

        <p>
          Long ago, before time itself had a name, the cosmos trembled beneath the
          footsteps of ancient titans. Their clashes sent shockwaves through the
          newborn universe, shaping stars, cracking worlds, and birthing reality
          itself.
          <br><br>
          Among these titanic beings rose a single ruler—Chronos, the god of time.
          Yet his reign was poisoned by fear. A prophecy whispered that one of his
          children would overthrow him, and so Chronos devoured each child at birth,
          believing he could consume fate itself.
          <br><br>
          But one child escaped.
          <br><br>
          Zeus was hidden away by his mother and raised in secrecy. He grew strong
          not only in power, but in patience and wisdom. When the time came, Zeus
          returned disguised as a servant. Chronos, blinded by arrogance, never
          suspected the truth.
          <br><br>
          Zeus poisoned his father’s drink, freeing his imprisoned siblings—Hades
          and Poseidon. Together, the brothers rose in rebellion, beginning the war
          that would shatter the Titans and crown Zeus as king of the gods.
